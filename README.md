# Animal Rescue in Ireland

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this report is to provide information on the costs associated with animal rescues in Ireland. By analyzing data on the expenses incurred and the types of animals and interventions involved, was aimed to identify ways to reduce the annual expenditure on animal rescues through preventive measures.

## Solution Statement
An exploratory analysis of a dataset containing records of animal rescues in Ireland from 2009 to 2022 will be conducted with the goal of identifying the animal groups and service types per animal groups that contribute the most to the expenses incurred. By understanding the factors contributing to these costs, recommendations for further studies and interventions that will help to create preventive approaches to these issues and ultimately reduce the expenditure on animal rescues in Ireland can be made. The aim of this solution is to gain a better understanding of the areas where the greatest expenses are incurred in animal rescues.

## Conclusion
Cats are frequently in need of rescue, and this has become a growing issue, with costs rising more than 80% from 2019 to 2022. The main cause of these interventions is cats being stuck in high places, accounting for 42.2% of cases from 2009 to 2022, followed by incidents involving traps, which represent 28.3% of the total events.
An interesting finding is that livestock animals represents a small part of the total amount expended registered from the period analysed, with about 5% of the incidents.
During warm periods, a phenomenon known as High-Rise Syndrome often occurs, as people tend to leave windows open, increasing the likelihood of cats falling or getting stuck in places they cannot escape from on their own1. Risk communication can be an effective way to reduce the number of incidents and inform cat owners of the risks to their pets and how to mitigate them. Multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand the causes of these issues and identify ways to reduce them, as well as to answer questions such as:
- When do the cases start to increase during the year?
-	Are there any modifications that need to be made to the homes of owners to reduce the risk of these issues?
-	Who is the main audience for effective risk communication, taking into consideration areas with a higher number of cases, the age of pet owners, and the main media (social media, television, magazines, etc.)?
Rescue from height continues to be a problem, with birds being rescued 1141 times between 2009 and 2022, representing 62.2% of incidents related to this issue. Fledgling (ready to fly) and nestling (too young to fly) birds are a critical period when birds may be injured by falls or become stuck2. Further studies are necessary to understand:
Is there a specific period of the year when these cases occur more frequently? - What are the main species that this happens to and what is their normal behavior? - Where do they typically build their nests? - What is their size? - Are there engineering solutions or is it possible to create ones that will reduce the number of occurrences? - In Ireland, an average of more than €150,000 is spent each year on cat and bird rescues. Further studies are needed to determine how much could be saved in implicit costs by taking the recommended actions above. A reduction of 20% in the number of cases would represent a saving of €30,000 per year and €150,000 over a period of 5 years.
In conclusion, this report can serve as a valuable resource for new multidisciplinary studies in the years ahead, and we hope that it will help to guide efforts to reduce animal rescues in Ireland. By combining the insights and expertise of various disciplines, such as veterinary medicine, animal behavior, and public policy, it’s possible to develop more comprehensive and effective strategies.
